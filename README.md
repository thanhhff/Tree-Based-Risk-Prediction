# Tree-Based-Risk-Prediction

### Preriquirements 

Before you begin, you must install Python 3 and set up the environment as described below:

If you wish, you can create env using Anaconda / Miniconda or Python Env. Below, I'll demonstrate how I create my environment using Python's venv command.
```
python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>
```

For instance, the name of my environment is 'env':
```
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate `env`:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements library in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
